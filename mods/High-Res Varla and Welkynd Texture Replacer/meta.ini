nexusDescription="[center][b][size=3]High-Res Varla & Welkynd Texture Replacer v2.0[/size][/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />==================================\r<br />DESCRIPTION\r<br />==================================\r<br />This mod replaces the stock varla and welkynd stone textures with high resolution versions. \xa0This mod also and optionally replaces some Ayleid meshes with versions that have doubled the size of the UV map for varla, welkynd, and iron textures, giving them an even higher-resolution appearance. \xa0This mod is packaged modularly, so you can use the textures standalone, or the meshes standalone with vanilla textures or another texture replacer, or use it all together.\r<br />\r<br />The base varla and welkynd textures came from Meo&#39;s Ayleid Clutter resource. \xa0I color-matched them to stock, and created a new high-constrast glow map. \xa0Now all varla & welkynd stone in your game will be as pretty as Meo&#39;s. \xa0The new iron texture is modified from QTP3, and thus will blend well with vanilla textures, or any other replacer that sticks to the stock color scheme.\r<br />\r<br />New this version:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Fixed the UV on some stock welkynd/varla cluster meshes and included them as an install option. \xa0\r<br />\r<br />[*]Also included an install option of fixed stock meshes with 2x scaled UV maps, which results in the textures appearing at twice the resolution.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Included replacement meshes that would also double the UV scale of many iron textures used in Ayleid Ruins.\r<br />\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />==================================\r<br />NEED HELP?
