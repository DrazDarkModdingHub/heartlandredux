nexusDescription="This is my first proper texture pack release. It&#39;s a high res overhaul of the Imperial fort dungeon interiors. They were made to carefully preserve the tone and feel of the original textures. Like other texture packs these are mainly derived from upscaled versions of the low res originals, but I made sure to put a lot of manual work into them rather than just add a simple detail overlay, and add things like sharper edge definitions which is something you otherwise simply won&#39;t get by upscaling.\r<br />\r<br />I have also recently updated my sound overhaul [b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45214/]GOSH[/url][/b], so be sure to download the latest update, or check it out if you haven&#39;t heard of it before&#33;"
