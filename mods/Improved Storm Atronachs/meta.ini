nexusDescription="This mod is a high resolution total re-work of the vanilla storm atronachs.\r<br />The original ones were well done and impressive, but they need bringing up\r<br />to date for the modern modded game.\r<br />\r<br />Key features:\r<br />\r<br />~Complete hi-res re-work of the texture, normal map and glow map,\r<br />keeping the original style, but with a much more solid grainy appearance.\r<br />\r<br />~Most of the seams re-touched in Blender.\r<br />\r<br />~Addition of a variable glow effect from the hotter more charged parts of\r<br />the rocks.\r<br />\r<br />~Material variables altered to give a harder, higher-contrast look.\r<br />\r<br />In addition, there is an optional texture-replacer provided to make the\r<br />shock-effect look subtler and much sharper. Be aware that this will replace\r<br />the shock effect throughout the whole game, so if you are already using a\r<br />replacer, make a backup of it before installing."
