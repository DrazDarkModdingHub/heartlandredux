nexusDescription="Reading through comments to recent mods I came across [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/49260?tab=posts]this end-of-March-2019 discussion[/url]. Since 1Mac and Oooiii are nice guys, and they had a point saying that KOTN books already show their age, here's a little surprise for them - and of course for anyone else who shares their admiration for an expensive, good looking bookshelf.\n<br />\n<br />Now, I personally reckon that this new resolution (2048x1024) might be considered slightly overkill for an in-game book cover ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/27521/]the original rob_b's covers[/url] which this mod is inspired by always looked good enough for me), but then there's only a few of these books around, and we all wanted some eye candy after all.\n<br />\n<br />To benefit from these new textures [color=green][b]you require the esp from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/27521/]Book Jackets KOTN[/url][/b][/color]. Without it you won't be able to see any changes. My mod simply updates that mod's models and textures so that they don't look 10 years old anymore. I made these textures from scratch (and modified UV layout - hence you need my nifs too), but I based the overwhelming majority of them on rob_b's original ideas as they seemed very nice to me. The only cover I based on Bethesda KOTN books rather than on Book Jackets KOTN is [i]Knights of the Nine[/i]. This one resembles vanilla but with fireworks and sparkles brought by new technology.\n<br />I also took a few liberties with [i]Shezarr and the Divines[/i], but kept it rather close to the color scheme of rob_b's version.\n<br />The piece of woolen fabric on the cover of Adabal-a is rumored to be a genuine fragment of Pelinal's cloak!\n<br />\n<br />[color=orange]To install[/color], first you require the original esp from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/27521/]Book Jackets KOTN[/url]. (Don't forget to endorse that mod!) Then install my HD update. You can install the whole original mod as is, of course \x2013 and overwrite it with my files. \n<br />\n<br />As a bonus I included a higher quality texture for side view of book pages (shared by all books in the game). If you don't like them, you can always revert to your backed-up files (you backed them up didn't you?) or to vanilla texture - the path you're looking for is Data-&gt;Textures-&gt;clutter-&gt;books-&gt;bookpages01.dds, and bookpages01_n.dds.\n<br />\n<br />I used as elements of these book covers a jumble of photos publicly available on the internet. The ones that deserve special mention are:\n<br />Olaf Janssen's [url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Back_of_brown_leather_binding_with_gilt_stamped,_made_in_France_in_circa_1770,_Psalter_of_Eleanor_of_Aquitaine_(ca._1185)_-_KB_76_F_13,_achterplat.jpg][i]Psalter of Eleanor of Aquitaine[/i][/url];\n<br />Couleur345's [url=https://www.deviantart.com/couleur345/art/Old-Book-67670065]Old Book[/url];\n<br />Bryony Taylor's [url=https://bryonytaylor.com/book-texture-jpg/]Book Texture[/url];\n<br />National Library of Medicine's [url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/pharmaceutics16.html]Medieval [i]The Book of Food and Drink[/i][/url][i].[/i]\n<br />\n<br />I hope you enjoy this mod. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to comment, ask, or upload your images.\n<br />\n<br />Happy modding!"
