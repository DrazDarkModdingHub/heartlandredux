nexusDescription="Increases the size of tree/shrub billboards and canopy shadows in the Shivering Isles to 125%/150% for those using Enhanced Vegetation by LprMan.\n<br />\n<br />Enhanced Vegetation changes the size of every tree/shrub in the game by altering the game setting fTreeSizeConversion, but LprMan only included billboard (LOD) changes for the flora in Tamriel. This is very noticeable if you're using the 150% version in the Shivering Isles, since all the tiny little tree billboards will turn into gigantic monster trees as soon as you get close. So basically, I just made this esp to fill in the gap and make sure SI's vegetation will scale properly as well. I'm actually pretty surprised no one else has gotten around to doing it after all this time.\n<br />\n<br />Unlike LprMan's version I didn't include any new textures or alter the grass sway speed for different timescales, I was much lazier about it and just changed the scaling of the already existing billboards along with the trees' shadow canopies. I also didn't make a 110% version since there's not as much of a noticeable difference, but I guess I can make one if someone asks.\n<br />\n<br />So if that wasn't clear, either of the plugins from this mod are compatible with any plugin from LprMan's mod no matter the timescale. Just pick the matching size and you're good to go. I'm not sure what happens with SI's grass if you're using a different timescale, but this won't change anything compared to before. I'd say it's easier to just go with the default timescale (30) and call it a day though.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Installation\n<br />[/u][/b]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/23783/]Enhanced Vegetation by LprMan[/url] - You only need to download the plugin of your choice from here.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/36411]Enhanced Vegetation - Darker trunks version by Xtudo[/url] -\xa0\x46ixes an issue with LprMan's billboards, I suggest using the normal res textures.\n<br />\n<br />Enhanced Vegetation SI.esp should be fine anywhere in your load order and you can merge the esp into your bashed patch.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Optional[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/35324]New shadows for trees by Obertier[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Leave a comment if you have any issues, have fun!"
