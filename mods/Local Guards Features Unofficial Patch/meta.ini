nexusDescription="[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45517/]Local Guard Features[/url] by tbsk\xa0is a great mod for townguard armors. It changes the townguard's equipment to be more diverse in appearance.\n<br />\n<br />The mod however has slight incompatibilities with the Unofficial Patches\xfeff as well as the Knights of the Nine official DLC.\xa0So this replacer esp is intended to rectify those issues.\n<br />\n<br />The\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5296]Unofficial Oblivion Patch[/url]\xfeff and the Knights of the Nine are now masters of tbskGuardsFeatures.esp, with all relevant and appropriate unofficial patches changes forwarded. Bash tags have also been applied where the original mod lacked them. This mod also requires the original\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45517/]Local Guard Features[/url]\xfeff\xa0\x61ssets to be installed beforehand.\n<br />\n<br />The OOO patch did not need changing."
