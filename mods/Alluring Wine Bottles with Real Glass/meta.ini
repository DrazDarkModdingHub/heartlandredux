nexusDescription="I was looking for good looking wine and beer bottles, and in the end I chose a mod charmingly named [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/34111/?]Alluring Wine Bottles[/url] because I felt it had the most believable-looking labels (although I'm still not 100 percent happy with them - they look tad too modern, but yeah, they're the best).\n<br />The only thing that bothered me with this mod - and all the others - were low quality glass as well as its opaqueness. So within the limits of my short break from work I sat down and slapped up glass that I feel looks more realistic. When you look very close you'll see that bottles are empty - no booze inside really - but then you don't often stick your nose into them anyway, do you?\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/users/238762]jbvw[/url] - the author of original Alluring Wine Bottles - has stated that: \"You may use these bottles anyway you would like, just don't claim them as your own.\" Therefore I decided to repack them as loose files instead of bsa, because this way you can import the esp into the bash patch which saves you a precious slot. Of course you need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22368/?]Wrye Bash[/url] for that. Other installation methods are okay (I assume, though I don't use them), but WB is recommended for exactly this reason.\n<br />\n<br />I've modified jbvw's wine and beer bottle meshes to add transparency and boost glossiness. I've also made new colour and normal maps for red, green, and brown bottles. I left skooma alone, but I'll probably get back to it once I know for sure what I want with it.\n<br />I might also have another look at the labels at some point in future, so stay tuned :)\n<br />\n<br />[color=blue]*UPDATE December 2021*\n<br />The updated file has the Alluring Wine Bottles.esp modified by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/users/12692318?tab=about+me]Dispensation[/url] in such a way that it has correct bash tags, and also remodels the SI mead.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />There should be no conflicts with other mods. If you find any, let me know and I use my limited skills to try and fix them.\n<br />\n<br />[color=yellow]Please, let me know if you need a similar thing as direct replacer for vanilla bottles, too. Or for any other mod that requires Real Glass.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Note to myself - I've got to see about Shadowbanish Wine...\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Cheers! And to Tobjoern, Skol!"
