nexusDescription="== Falling Stars ==\r\n\r\nScreenshots obviously don\\'t work very well for this mod, Youtube is giving me trouble right now. I\\'ll upload a video later. But hey, I guess you\\'ve seen a falling star already...doesn\\'t look much different than in real life.\r\n\r\nA tiny mod that adds falling stars to the game. They appear randomly at night when the sky is clear, the amount can be adjusted via console. \r\n\r\nPlease note that they only appear when the sky is 100% clear. There are weather types that look pretty clear, but aren\\'t 100% clear. This mod works in any worldspace that has clear weather (but not in interiors for obvious reasons).\r\n\r\nTo adjust the frequency of the falling stars type \\'set PTStarTimer to x\\' into the console, where x is the maximum amount of seconds between stars spawning. Default is 20. So if you think there are too many stars spawning you could type \\'set PTStarTimer to 60\\' for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n= Installation = \r\n\r\nPut the meshes and textures folders as well as the PTFallingStars.esp into your Oblivion\\\\Data folder. Check the esp in the launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n= Permission =\r\n\r\nYou can do with this mod whatever you want, just give credits.\r\n\r\n"
