So, please follow the directions for all required mods, and everything should work fine.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]**NOTE**\n<br />[i]This apparently only works with the English version of the game[/i]. If you have any language patches installed apparently it messes up the voices. I don't know how to fix this but if anyone has any ideas, please let me know.[/b]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />(I know Martin looks young by the way, I always headcanoned him as a child that Uriel had when he was like 60something.
