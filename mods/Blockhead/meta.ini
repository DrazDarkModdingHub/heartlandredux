Born in a robber button and brought up by a Dachshund named Colin, it learnt the harsh facts of reality early. Only to laugh at its face, tweak its nose and drop ice cubes down its vestments.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Over the course of its unnecessarily long and insipid life, it has achieved a great many things, such as:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]The compulsory serving of asparagus at breakfast.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Unrestricted camera movement in the race edit menu.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The ability to override the inventory menu\x2019s idle animations.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The induction of the word \x2018\x63ontrafibularities\x2019 in the Oxford English dictionary.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The ability to override head and body assets of NPCs on a per-NPC/per-Race basis.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The ability to override animations of NPCs on a per-NPC/per-Race basis.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Tidyman\x2019s carpets.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[u][b]Fine Print[/b][/u]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />The camera in the race/sex menu can be controlled with the directional keys (arrow keys and WSAD) and the mouse (while holding down the Shift key). It can be reset to its original position by clicking on the left mouse button and dragging. Movement and rotation speeds can be configured in the plugin\x2019s INI file.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Inventory idle animation overriding allows custom idle animations to be applied on the inventory menu\x2019s 3D player model without resorting to replacing existing assets. There are 8 available overrides, from which one is automatically selected by the engine depending upon the player character\x2019s equipped weapon. The override values in the INI file should be set to the filename+extension of a valid KF file placed inside the MeshesCharacters_Male directory.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Blockhead implements a 3-tier override tool for customizing NPC body/head textures and meshes:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Tier 1 (Script) \x2013 Applied by using script commands.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=2]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Tier 2 (Per-NPC) \x2013 Applied by placing assets (textures/models) in the following folder: &lt;TexturesMeshes&gt;Characters&lt;BodyHead&gt;AssetOverridesPerNPC&lt;ModFileName.ext&gt;.[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Asset naming convention: 00XXXXXX_&lt;PartName&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;, where XXXXXX \x2013 FormID of the NPC (without the mod index).Auxiliary files such as normal maps, TRI, EGM, EGT files, etc. need to be similarly named, i.e, &lt;FileNameAsAbove&gt;_n.dds.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][*][size=2]Tier 3 (Per-Race) \x2013[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Body: Applied by placing assets in the following folder: &lt;TexturesMeshes&gt;CharactersBodyAssetOverridesPerRace&lt;MF&gt; (where MF corresponds to the gender of the NPC).Asset naming convention: XXX_&lt;BodyPartName&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;, where XXX \x2013 Name of the race.\n<br />\n<br />Head: Head part asset overrides work differently. Since all head part related paths are defined, by default, at the Race level, overrides are only used to support gender variance. The override file paths are automatically derived from the originals defined in the Race record.Asset naming convention: &lt;Original PathFilename&gt;_&lt;MF&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;, where M/F \x2013 Gender.As with Tier 2, auxiliary files need to be renamed appropriately.[/size][/list]\n<br />Valid BodyPart Names:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]UpperBody[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]LowerBody[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Hand[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Foot[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Tail[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Valid HeadPart Names:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Head[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]EarsMale[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]EarsFemale[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Mouth[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]TeethLower[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]TeethUpper[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Tongue[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]EyesLeft\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 (Model override only)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]EyesRight\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 (Model override only)[/size]\n<br />[/list]\xa0\n<br />Order of precedence: Tier 1 &gt; Tier 2 &gt; Tier 3 &gt; Default Asset.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Tier 1 overrides do not persist between game sessions and therefore need to be reapplied on loading a save game.\n<br />\n<br />Body/Head parts without a pre-assigned asset can also be overridden, i.e., parts that do not have a valid model/texture path assigned in the editor. Tier 3 overrides for such head parts, however, must be placed in the following directory:\n<br />&lt;TexturesMeshes&gt;CharactersHeadAssetOverridesPerRace&lt;MF&gt; (where MF corresponds to the gender of the NPC)\n<br />\x2026with the following naming convention: XXX_&lt;HeadPartName&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;\n<br />\n<br />In addition to the aforementioned head parts, Blockhead adds limited overriding support for the following:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Hair \x2013 Hair assets can be assigned gender-specific files by adding a \x2018-M\x2019 or \x2018-F\x2019 suffix to their filenames.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Age Overlays \x2013 Age textures can be overridden on a per-NPC basis through script commands or custom assets placed in the following folder: TexturesCharactersAgeTextureOverrides&lt;ModFileName.ext&gt;.\xa0\x46ile naming convention: 00XXXXXX_YY.dds, where XXXXXX \x2013 FormID of the NPC (without the mod index), and YY \x2013 Age. Script overrides supersede the latter, do not persist b\x2019ween game sessions.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\xa0\n<br />NPC animations can be overridden on a per-NPC/per-Race basis too. Animation overrides are implemented as special animations internally. All animation files need to be placed in the following directory: MeshesCharacters_MaleSpecialAnims.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Per-NPC \x2013 Override files must use the following naming convention: &lt;Filename&gt;_BLKD_PERNPC_XXX_00YYYYYY.kf, where XXX \x2013 Name of the mod file name + extension, YYYYYY \x2013 FormID of the NPC record, without the mod index.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Per-Race \x2013 Override files must use the following naming convention: &lt;Filename&gt;_BLKD_PERRACE_XXX_Y.kf, where XXX \x2013 Name of the race, Y \x2013 Gender (M/F).[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />[/size][size=2]The first part of the filename must follow the same naming convention as the vanilla game\x2019s, e.g., BowIdle_PERRACE_Nord_M.[/size][/list]\n<br />\xa0\n<br />An NPC can be affected by more than one override at the same time \x2013 The engine has the final say on which animation file gets used (the actual mechanics of the picking logic is yet to be discovered/understood).\n<br />\n<br />Equipment override - Refer to the readMe.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />The plugin\x2019s INI file is generated after first run (in the same folder as the DLL file) and contains options to toggle its features.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />It is recommended that Blockhead be used in tandem with the NPC Tex Tweak plugin, which offers users more avenues to customize NPC textures.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[u][b]Compatibility[/b]\xa0[/u]\n<br />\n<br />This plugin is compatible with every other OBSE plugin there is. Should you find a discrepancy, please report it through the contact avenues as stated below.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />Animation overrides will not work on NPCs that use non-standard file paths for their skeletons, i.e., skeleton meshes must be placed in the MeshesCharacters_Male directory. Special animations added using OBSE\x2019s ToggleSpecialAnim script command may be superseded by Blockhead\x2019s overrides occasionally. Overrides for some animation groups (such as Cast) may not work consistently.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Credits[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4a460][i]Special thanks[/i][/color]\xa0to :\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Ian Patterson, Stephen Abel and Paul Connelly (The OBSE Team) \x2013 For keeping up the Oblivion Modding spirit and providing the modding community with TES4 Oblivion's Elixir of Immortality[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]LHammonds \x2013 For his Readme generator[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]nuska - For keeping me occupied on a Sunday.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]scanti \x2013 For the NPC Tex Tweak plugin and his pioneering work in the field of engine extension.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The Rest of the Modding Community \x2013 For the inspiration I needed to start modding and all the wonderful mods which I use.\n<br />Bethesda \x2013 For providing a rather malleable game.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Change Log[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler][quote]\n<br />11.1 - Fix persistent CTDs (in Shivering Isles, Peryite\x2019s realm, etc), fix body override normal maps not being overridden correctly, fix overridden equipment not unequipping correctly\n<br />11.0 - Add support for equipment overrides\n<br />10.3 - Fix body override script commands\n<br />10.2 \x2013 Fix hotfix, change override file naming convention for gender variant hair assets\n<br />10.1 - Hotfix for missing body parts and clothes\n<br />10.0 -\xa0\x41\x64\x64s support for body EGT overrides, fix CTD on save game load, fix gender variant\n<br />hair texture overrides, fix ResetAgeTextureOverride script command\n<br />9.2 - Bug fixes\n<br />9.1 \x2013 Changed anim override file naming convention, added a script command to toggle anim overrides, bug fixes\n<br />9.0 \x2013 Allowed overrides for body/head parts without default assets, added age texture and hair overriding, bug fixes\n<br />8.1 \x2013 Fixed various bugs, removed the unused (and buggy) \x2018Idle\x2019 inventory idle override\n<br />8.0 \x2013 Upgraded to VS 2012 C++ runtimes, added tier-based overriding for head assets, added animation overriding, bug fixes\n<br />7.0 \x2013 Added support for body model overrides, updated script commands, implemented 3-tier system\n<br />6.0 \x2013 Added support for scripted body texture overrides, FaceGen age getter/setter commands, removed pre-generated face texture related patches (the NPC Tex Tweak provides a more complete solution to the issue)\n<br />5.1 \x2013 Fixed a body texture override related CTD\n<br />5.0 \x2013 Implemented per-NPC body texture overriding\n<br />4.0 - Implemented inventory idle overriding\n<br />3.1 - Fixed age texture pathing\n<br />3.0 \x2013 Added RaceSexMenu camera poser\n<br />2.0 - Added editor support\n<br />1.0 - Initial Release[/quote][/spoiler]"
