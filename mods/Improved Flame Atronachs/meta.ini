nexusDescription="The vanilla Flame Atronachs featured sequenced flame animations that were redundant, since animation effects don&#39;t work on skinned geometry (using translation or NiFlip controllers). This is due to skinned geometries requiring a normal-map to be present in order to work. Several ways were tried to get around this, but the fancy looking versions that worked in NifSkope didn&#39;t work in-game.\r<br />So the approach has been to improve everything else, namely textures and normal-maps, UV mapping, material properties, removal of vertex-colour block and tweaking of glow-effect transition keys.\r<br />\r<br />An additional fireflameparticle texture is included... it will replace that of other mods if used, but should not look out-of place and fixes the horizontal-stretch of the particle emitter."
