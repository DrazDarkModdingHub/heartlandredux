nexusDescription="[img]http://i.imgur.com/fetdUo7.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />A new nice farm fence texture which makes that wood more realistic. The size is 1024x1024 (both color and normal maps) and 512x512 for the log ends. The same as Quarl&#39;s QTP3, but better performance thanks to adjustments in all UV maps. The point of remapping was to make the meshes use the texture more effectively.\r<br />\r<br />I dedicate this retex to late Quarl whose comprehensive retex was the first mod that made my TES4 beautiful back in the old times.\r<br />\r<br />I encourage you to upload your images :)\r<br />\r<br />Install either with your favourite manager - preferably Wrye Bash, or manually. It should work with NMM, but I can&#39;t tell for sure since I \r<br />don&#39;t use it, as NMM wasn&#39;t designed with Oblivion in mind. If you ever want to replace this texture, modify it, or restore it, here are the \r<br />files affected by it:\r<br />\r<br />textures/architecture/farmhouse/\r<br />fireplankwide01.dds\r<br />fireplankwide01_n.dds\r<br />logend.dds\r<br />logend_n.dds\r<br />plankwidestain01.dds\r<br />plankwidestain01_n.dds\r<br />\r<br />meshes/architecture/farmfence/\r<br />2wayfence.nif\r<br />brokenfence.nif\r<br />cornerfencefull.nif\r<br />cornerfencesmall.nif\r<br />cornerslopea.nif\r<br />cornerslopeb.nif\r<br />fencegateanimation.nif\r<br />fencegateframenopost.nif\r<br />fencelent01.nif\r<br />fencelenttri01.nif\r<br />fencelenttrislope32.nif\r<br />fencelenttrislope64.nif\r<br />fencelenttrislope96.nif\r<br />fencepost2way.nif\r<br />fenceposttri2way.nif\r<br />fenceposttri3way.nif\r<br />fenceposttri4way.nif\r<br />fenceposttricorner.nif\r<br />fenceposttriend.nif\r<br />gatefence.nif\r<br />gatehousingfence.nif\r<br />slopeafence.nif\r<br />slopebfence.nif\r<br />\r<br />Initially I used my own images, but in the end I settled on resource photos from [url]http://texturelib.com[/url] which I heavily manipulated, and used them to make seamless textures. Many thanks to that website for always providing top quality photos. And as usual, thanks to Bethesda for such a mod-friendly game.\r<br />\r<br />You can&#39;t redistribute meshes, as they come from vanilla game with only UV maps modified by myself, so they&#39;re property of Bethesda. As for the textures, you can do with them whatever you fancy. If you use them for your project it would be nice to get credit for my work, and a link would be super cool."
