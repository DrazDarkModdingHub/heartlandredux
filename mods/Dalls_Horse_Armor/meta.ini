nexusDescription="---README---\r\n\r\nfor DALLs-Horse Armor\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n\r\n06.01.2008\r\n\r\n\r\nRoyal Ayleid and Iron Horse are new Textures for Bethesda Horse Armor plug-in. Note prior to download that this are textures only and not whole Horse Armor Plug-in! Official Horse Armor plug-in is necessary! \r\n\r\nThese Textures are something I have made for myself some time ago. Bethesda original textures are great but I have found them a bit bland in execution thus this re-skin. Royal Ayleid is re-skin of Elven Horse Armor and Iron Horse of Steel Horse Armor.  \r\n\r\nDue to the unfortunate fact that Horse Armor is Bethesda\\'s Official pay for plug-in there are no alternatives to this two meshes they have supplied thus yet another Elven and Steel Horse Armor mod. \r\n\r\nRoyal Ayleid is my idea of golden fit for King horse armor while Iron Horse one is well worn and boiler black working horse attire. Both armors shine and visually behave as real metal ones would. This in the game of course ;)\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nThis new textures are substitute and as such don\\'t need .esp (plug-in file) but Archive Invalidation (BSA redirect) is necessary! BSA redirection (in game textures replacement) can be achieved in a couple ways depending on what you are comfortable with but I would recommend to anyone to use ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated! This brilliant mod by Quarn can be found at: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10724\r\n\r\nIf you are wondering what this mod does it forces Oblivion game engine to use new (replacement) textures instead of \r\nBethesda originals. This mod is one of the must haves as many other change-of-texture mods depend on BSA redirection as well.\r\n\r\nInstall and activate (check) ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated! \r\n\r\nExtract my Data files directly into your Oblivion (game) folder. Alternatively extract (unpack) them to your desktop, check file structure if you deem it necessary, copy-paste in your Oblivion (game) folder. Allow overwrite if asked for! Backup your files if you want to restore your textures to some previous moded state.\r\n\r\nTo restore your game to original Bethesda Horse Armor textures you will need to delete my meshes and textures from your Oblivion/Data / ... /Creatures/Horse folder. \r\n\r\nConflicts: \r\n\r\nThere should not be any as long as ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated! is active. If it is switched off or removed game will revert to original textures. My Meshes .NIF and Textures .dds files are intended to work together and removal or replacement of any might lead to unexpected results.\r\n\r\nUse:\r\n\r\nUse it as you like without need to contact me for permission but due credit is expected.\r\n\r\nEnjoy! ;)\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for great game.\r\n"
