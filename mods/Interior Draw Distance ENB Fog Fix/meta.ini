nexusDescription="[b]DIY Info:[/b]\xa0Sorry, I have left the Oblivion and Fallout 3. Still on Skyrim and Fallout 4 though. I am unable to make compat patches as I have the games uninstalled. If you are having compatibility issues, I recommend you create your own similar patch. For this I used xEdit filters and expanded and highlighted all cells or lighting templates, then I use the\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49373]Automation Tools for TES5Edit[/url]\xfeff (Yes, it was built for Skyrim, but most of its scripts works perfectly on most xedit versions for any game, tested on Oblivion, FO3, FO4, SkyLE, SkySE). To do this, the cells/lighting templates I have filtered, expanded, and highlighted, I right click and copy them as Override on an new ESP, then select all records on the newly created ESP, right click and apply script:\xa0[b]AT - QuickChange v2.4.pas[/b], use the formula function. Set the path to the path you want to edit (This can be any path you want, perfect for bulk editing and mod making) in this case\xa0[b]Fog Clip Distance[/b]\xa0or\xa0[b]Fog Clip Dist[/b]\xa0(IIRC been awhile) then set the value to\xa0[b]9999999\xa0[/b]or any large number. To get more info on which records to edit, open this mod on xEdit. IIRC it should only be interior cells and lighting templates. Good luck! Happy modding... with this method you can also now create weightless patches, price fixes, name sorts, and much much more.\n<br />\n<br />EDIT: Let me know if it worked as expected. If it does and you need compatibility patches for a lighting mod or etc. let me know.\n<br />\n<br />Fixes the very short clipping distance on interiors. This bug is not noticeable in the vanilla game but it is very noticeable when playing with mods that disable interior fog or with ENB that handles fog differently.\n<br />\n<br />See images above provided by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3918353]Dahveed[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />\n<br />This is the TES4 Oblivion version of the Fallout 3 mod:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/23592]Interior Draw Distance ENB Fog Fix (FALLOUT 3)[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Compatibility:\n<br />\n<br />This was accomplished by setting the Fog Clip Distance (basically Draw Distance) from the default value to 9999999 on all interior cell records.\n<br />This would not be compatible with mods that alter them which includes most interior lighting mods. Creating compatibility patches would be easy. I just don't know where to start or if this is even needed with those as I personally don't use any lighting mods as the ENB I'm using is doing a great job already with just the vanilla lighting system to play with. If you do have a lighting mod in mind, let me know.\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />All DLC's\n<br />Built with GOTY version of the game.\n<br />Unofficial Fixes Patch cell changes integrated.\n<br />\n<br />Performance:\n<br />\n<br />This might affect performance as the entire cell will now be in the Draw Distance range. I use an i5 4th Gen, 8GB ram, GTX 750Ti 2GB and no noticeable impact so far. Again, IT MIGHT HAVE PERFORMANCE IMPACT, but it is highly unlikely. This game loads entire cells even without this mod and only the visible draw distance is edited."
