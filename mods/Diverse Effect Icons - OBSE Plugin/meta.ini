nexusDescription="Diverse Effect Icons introduces unique icons for most of the magic effects which doesn't already have a unique icon. You can see it on the picture.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]This patch is rather simple - it changes the way Diverse Effect Icons work so magic effect forms are not edited directly - instead, they are patched in memory using OBSE functions. This makes it compatible with almost everything and removes the need for a translation.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Since there is no clear permissions set by riklund, I decided not to include any files from the original mod - just the .esp file itself.\n<br />So go and get the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/10254]original mod[/url] and don't forget to endorse it !\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]You'll only need \"[i]Textures[/i]\" folder from the original mod, I repeat, [b][color=#ff0000]DO NOT[/color][/b] install original esps.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />If you're running OOO, make sure that OOO's bsa last modified date is set earlier than original Diverse Effects texture files last modified date (08 April 2007), otherwise OOO is gonna take priority with its icon replacement which is imo worse.\n<br />\n<br />This patch also includes additional optional functionality for changing default Script Effect icon, you can read about it in included ini file.\n<br />If you don't want any changes to Script Effect icon, simply don't install/remove [i]Ini&#92;Diverse Effect Icons OBSE.ini[/i]."
