nexusDescription="=======================\r\nName: MenuQue\r\nVersion: 16a\r\nAuthor: Kyoma\r\nThread: http://http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1455885-relz-menuque-3/\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n----------\r\nThis plugin for the Oblivion Script Extender is the result of me looking into how both OBSE works and how the game works. It began as a small plugin with only a handful of UI and quest functions. But it quickly grew far larger than I could have ever imagined. For a full list of functions and descriptions check out the documentation in the archive. But it is safe to say that the bulk of these functions allow for greater and/or easier manipulation of the UI (through script) aswell as help create new UI elements or whole new menus. The possibilities are nearly endless.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther features:\r\n\t* The ability to load an additional 25 extra fonts, giving a larger variaty to choose from.\r\n\t* The ability to load additional strings.xml files, which the game uses as a source for string localization (e.g. language and translation).\r\n\t* Easy to use replication of the few hardcoded behaviours of the UI, like scrolling, dragging or small typing boxes.\r\n\t* The ability to create and manage additional skills using the amazing AddActorValues plugin.\r\n\t* A handful of fixes, enhancements and additions to the UI.\r\n\r\nFor a complete description on these features check out the cs wiki page for MenuQue here: http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/Category:MenuQue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install\r\n------------\r\n* Copy the Data folder and its content to your \\\"Oblivion\\\" folder. \r\n\t- This plugin requires OBSE v20 or higher! You can find the latest version at \\\"http://obse.silverlock.org/\\\"\r\n\t- To view the command documentation you can open the \\\"menuque_command_doc.html\\\" file in the archive or visit the TESNexus page for the latest version.\r\n\t- The ini file will be (re)created when needed.\r\n\t- (for modders) The name of the plugin (to be used with IsPluginInstalled) is \\\"OBSE_Kyoma_MenuQue\\\" and the current version number is 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo uninstall\r\n-------------\r\n* Delete or change the extension of the \\\"MenuQue.dll\\\" found in your \\\"Oblivion\\\\Data\\\\obse\\\\plugins\\\" folder. Optionally delete the \\\"MenuQue\\\" folder and \\\"MenuQue.ini\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n--------------\r\nThe only known incompatibility is with any of the \\\"asian language\\\" OBSE plugin. When used with any of those be sure to change \\\"bAllowExtraFonts\\\" to 0 in the ini. Otherwise it WILL crash your game.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion History\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nv16a\r\n\t* Fixed GetMousePos returning incorrect values. \r\n\r\nv16 \r\n\t* Made it possible to use an extra font directly in the xml by using its name as a token, e.g. &MyFont;\r\n\t* Fixed bug with scroll systems in menus that already have a vanilla scroll bar.\r\n\t* Fixed bug with undocumented xml string operators.\r\n\r\nv15\r\n\t* Minor changes to layout of source files and docs.\r\n\t* Now includes a dummy dll with the old filename (OBSE_Kyoma_MenuQue) to ensure the old dll doesn\\'t accidentally get loaded.\r\n\r\nv14a\r\n\t* Really fixed memory leak this time.\r\n\t* Added option to ShowMagicPopupMenu to force close it.\r\n\r\nv14 \r\n\t* Added GetAVSkillMasteryLevelC, GetAVSkillMasteryLevelF and tile_GetVar.\r\n\t* Fixed alignment issues with custom drag elements introduced by version 13.\r\n\t* Fixed bug in CS where books without a \\'teaching\\' skill were being saved as if teaching conjuration (21).\r\n\t* Fixed bug where GetBookSkillTaught command returned conjuration (21) instead of invalid (-1) for \\'non-teaching\\' books.\r\n\t* Fixed bug where GetTrainerSkill & GetBookSkillTaught return value was off by 21 for default skills.\r\n\t* Other fixes for skill-using forms (books, npcs, etc).\r\n\t* Fixed memory leak with tile traits\r\n\r\nv13d\r\n\t* Fix xml parse issues when a child element is defined before any traits.\r\n\t* Fix possible crash in the CS when a non-default skill has a default actor value.\r\n\t* Actor value box in the CS skill dialog no longer contains default actor values.\r\n\r\nv13c\r\n\t* Fixed bug where the menu would no longer be valid inside the \\\"OnClose\\\" menu event.\r\n\r\nv13b\r\n\t* Fixed rare bug where an xml trait with an initial value of 0 wasn\\'t displayed properly.\r\n\r\nv13a\r\n\t* Fixed skill experience not always initializing properly when starting a new game.\r\n\t* Fixed bug with hash notation in the \\\"tile_XXX\\\" commands when also specifying a name.\r\n\t* Added version check for AddActorValues to prevent problems with older versions.\r\n\r\nv13\r\n\t* Fixed possible crash on exit.\r\n\t* Fixed possible bug with overwritten commands that could make them behave slightly different.\r\n\t* Fixed fail-safe for using extra skills with other form (books & npcs) not working properly. Now it really is safe to use in mods without MenuQue.\r\n\t* Added GetSkillForm command.\r\n\r\nv12a\r\n\t* An intermediary version to confirm several bugfixes.\r\n\r\nv12\r\n\t* Fixed crash when closing the levelup menu.\r\n\t* Fixed crash when attempting to open a non-existing file with ShowGenericMenu.\r\n\t* Fixed required skill experience not always updating for extra skills, leading to the wrong values in the stats menu.\r\n\t* Added ShowLevelupMenu, GetAllSkills, GetTrainingMenuSkill, GetTrainingMenuLevel & GetTrainingMenuCost commands.\r\n\t* Changed GetSkillCode so the return value can safely be stored in script variables and can now be used with actor value code commands (GetAVC, ModAVC, SetAVC, etc). \r\n\t* Extra skills now work with OBSE\\'s OnSkillUp event, using the same value as what GetSkillCode returns.\r\n\t* Extra skills can now be used by books as teaching skill and by npcs as training skill, both in the CS and with the relative OBSE commands.\r\n\r\nv11b\r\n\t* Several fixes for X-Skills, it should now be in a more usable state.\r\n\t* Added GetSkillCode and \\'F\\' versions for most skill commands.\r\n\t* Added more options for X-Skills.\r\n\t* Added the option to fix case sensitivity for texture paths.\r\n\t* Added the option to configure the quickkeys in the controls menu.\r\n\t* Fixed a bug with OnClick and OnMouseover and corrected the docs on their parameters.\r\n\t* Fixed a bug with GetWorldMapDoor not working on new games until the map menu is opened.\r\n\r\nv11a\r\n\t* Hotfix for bug with mqGetMenuGlobalFloat and mqSetMenuGlobalFloat.\r\n\t\r\nv11\r\n\t* Changed internal structure and filenames. \r\n\t* Rewrote most internal code, providing many bugfixes in one big swoop.\r\n\t* Added missing GetTextEditBox and ShowTextEditMenu commands.\r\n\t* Fixed GetTextEditString not returning text from most recent box like it should.\r\n\t* Simplified tile_XXX commands.\r\n\t* Upped requirement to OBSE v20.\r\n\t* Added the \\\"X-Skills\\\" feature.\r\n\t* INI now contains small description for each setting.\r\n\r\nv10 beta5\r\n\t* Fixed menu events not working.\r\n\r\nv10 beta4\r\n\t* Fixed bug with InsertXML leading to faulty element names.\r\n\r\nv10 beta3\r\n\t* Fixed another crash with some of the UI commands.\r\n\r\nv10 beta2\r\n\t* Fixed ambiguity with numeric and string values in the UI, which led to the display of just a \\'0\\'.\r\n\t* Fixed crash with using text edit.\r\n\t* Other enhancements and tweaks.\r\n\r\nv10 beta1\r\n\t* Alot of internal changes, mostly passive and for future features.\r\n\t* A new (and hopefully final) set of UI commands: tile_GetFloat, tile_GetString and tile_SetValue. With much greater and more flexible usage.\r\n\t* A function to retrieve all loaded fonts (default and/or extra).\r\n\t* Commands for manipulating the text in small TextEdit boxes.\r\n\t* Added fix for message duration always being 3 seconds (default duration is configurable).\r\n\t* Added fix for the DUMMY text when there are no more ranks (text is now configurable). \r\n\t* Fixed a few possible problems with \\\"menu events\\\" and added a few new ones.\r\n\r\nv9a\r\n\t* Now really works with OBSE v19.\r\n\r\nv9\r\n\t* Lowered requirement to OBSE v19.\r\n\t* Fixed two crashes with background processes of the menu enhancements.\r\n\t* Fixed bug with GetWorldMapData not working properly for parented worldspaces.\r\n\t* Fixed bug with GetGenericButtonPressed not working properly\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n------------\r\n* The OBSE team for making OBSE and scruggsy in particular for decoding basic font-related stuff.\r\n* shadeMe, TheNiceOne, andalaybay, Claviticus for help debugging, suggestions and general support and motivation.\r\n* JRoush for his excellent work on COEF.\r\n* JRoush for his excellent work on AddActorValues.\r\n* All the others I may have forgotten, please don\\'t be mad...! :P"
