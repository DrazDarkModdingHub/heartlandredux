nexusDescription="Shiny Septims - Roman Aureus & Sestertius\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nBy: Painkiller_Rider & VagabondAngel\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n---------\r\nPainkiller_Rider - new textures and concept\r\nVagabondAngel - original mesh\r\n\r\nWhat it does?\r\n------------------\r\n- Replaces all the gold coins in the game with new meshes and textures.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n------------------\r\n1. Extract the included files and sub-folders to a temporary folder of your choice.\r\n2. Copy/over-write the sub-folders and files into \\\"Oblivion Install Folder\\\\Data\\\".\r\n3. Select ONE Esp file (of your choice) in your Data Files menu (selecting both will likely crash your game).\r\n3. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nImportant Notes:\r\n------------------\r\n- WARNING: this hereby mod is NOT based on Tamrielic lore, but rather on personal taste and choice. For a lore-friendly approach, please download VagabondAngel\\'s outstanding Better Gold replacer!\r\n- The coins present in this mod are reproductions of coins from the Roman Empire, as follows:\r\n\t- Septimus\\' Septims, based on an Aureus coin (.999 Gold!) minted under Emperor Septimus Severus (sic!). This coin has a better condition look, with the \tlettering and details showing up beautifully.\r\n\t- Trajan\\'s Septims, based on a Sestertius coin (bronze) minted under Emperor Trajan\\'s rule. This coin has a more battered look, with the original \t\tlettering worn out almost completely and missing the shine of the above Aureus.\r\n\r\n- Please require permission and give due credit for the use of these meshes and textures in your own mods! Failure to do so will result in aeternal damnation to the lowest plane of Oblivion! Lowest-resolution, that is...\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n----------------------\r\nBethesda for the great game and background for modding, VagabondAngel for the superb original work, Locthebard for the idea of bringing these coins to Oblivion and the TES community for being with me all along...\r\n\r\nPainkiller_Rider\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE RESOURCE RELEASE:\r\n- Adds a number of 7 new coin meshes, textures and icons: Iron, Copper, Nickel, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum - each mesh is slightly bigger from one denomination to the next; also, the Silver, Gold and Platinum meshes are using EnvMap2&Apply_Hilight, for a better shining effect.\r\n\r\n- Use them as you see fit - the included Esp has only a sample value, just for evaluation purposes. Will add a pair of each new coin in a cell named PainCoinsTest. The folders containing the above files are all named PainCoins and reside within each of their respective folders (Meshes, Textures and Textures\\\\Menus\\\\Icons).\r\n\r\n- The coins present in this mod are reproductions of real coins from the Roman and Greek ages, most based on the Roman Emperor Septimus Severus\\' coin issues.\r\n\r\n- This is a resource, so use it at your own will and risk. Giving due credit for the use of these meshes and textures in your own mods will be appreciated...\r\n\r\nMore in the included readme.\r\n\r\nChange Note: I have replaced Steel with Copper, same texture, just different color (not reflected in the screenshots)."
