nexusDescription="[img]http://i41.tinypic.com/jq29ab.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />This little mod actually comes from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7824//?]SkyrimNexus[/url] where I saw it first and totally fell in love with it. Since Yuril&#39;s awesome textures are free to convert to other games, I did not hesitate even for a while and went THIS IS MADNESS with Construction Set. \r<br />\r<br />What does it do? It simply replaces Bruma cobblestone and some paths in Jerall Mountains with snowy footprinted texture . I never realised before how much immersion it could add to the game (at last in my opinion). Well, it does. It looks like &#34;wow, someone really lives here&#33;&#34;.\r<br />Also it adds some more snow in regions that should be more snowy. I can&#39;t say if it needs some LOD generating. Hopefully not.\r<br />And there are few outdoor lamps in Bruma for a better illumination.\r<br />\r<br />Although texture is rather big, it blends good with snow from [url=http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/43473//?]Landscape HD[/url]. Sorry, I didn&#39;t try other landscape mods with this, but since we are talking about WHITE, it should look good everywhere, with everything. It should go smoothly with all the ENBs too. I can&#39;t try it now, sigh.\r<br />\r<br />All the credit goes to Yuril, I&#39;m just bringing his jewel here."
