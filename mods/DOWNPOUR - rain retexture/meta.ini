nexusDescription="=========================================\r<br />DOWNPOUR - A retexture of the Oblivion Rain\r<br />=========================================\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />Description\r<br />============\r<br />This mod replaces the default rain with a new texture that was designed to make rain appear more dramatic and heavy while still remaining performance friendly. The larger texture comes with custom meshes which give the rain more volume, and let you enjoy it as it&#39;s meant to.\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />Installation\r<br />============\r<br />Wrye Bash:\r<br />This mod is packed in BAIN-friendly format.\r<br />1. Highlight the 7zip package in the Installers window.\r<br />2. Tick either 00 Large (this is 256x256 pixels) or 01 Small (64 x 256 pixels), as well as 02 Readmes\r<br />3. Install.\r<br />4. Start the Oblivion and play.\r<br />5. Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Manual:\r<br />1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r<br />2. Copy the file of your choice (small or large) to your Oblivion Data folder. The file path is Oblivion &gt; Data &gt; Textures &gt; Sky\r<br />3. If prompted to overwrite the texture select yes to overwrite the default textures.\r<br />4. Start the Oblivion and play.\r<br />5. Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />In either case running Archive Invalidation right after installation is always a smart decision.\r<br />\r<br />==============\r<br />Uninstallation\r<br />==============\r<br />Just delete (or overwrite) the raindrop.dds file.\r<br />\r<br />===============\r<br />Incompatibility\r<br />===============\r<br />Since it&#39;s just a simple texture and mesh replacement, it shouldn&#39;t conflict with any mods that don&#39;t change the same files. It works great with All Natural and Imperial Firmament (if installed after them).\r<br />\r<br />==========\r<br />Change Log\r<br />==========\r<br />\r<br />ver. 01\r<br />These are the two main files (full and lightweight) of DOWNPOUR for Skyrim (version 1.1) made by Gamwich and repacked for Oblivion by maczopikczo with Gamwich&#39;s knowledge and blessing :)\r<br />\r<br />ver. 02\r<br />I added custom meshes with the larger texture in mind. The original was a tall, narrow triangle the size of one drop. Now it&#39;s a square sheet thanks to which the full blast of downpour can be seen and enjoyed.\r<br />\r<br />=======\r<br />Credits\r<br />=======\r<br />All credit for the texture goes to Gamwich - the original author of DOWNPOUR, available for Skyrim at [url]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56665/?[/url]\r<br />The mesh is my own variation of the vanilla.\r<br />A big thanks to Bethesda for creating the Elders Scrolls series, and making Oblivion such a great game for modding.\r<br />Just as big thanks to the creators of Blender and Niftools for making these things possible.\r<br />And thanks to Nexus for providing an invaluable resource to mod authors."
