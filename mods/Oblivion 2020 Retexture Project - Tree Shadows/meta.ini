with in the sense of 'I want that branch there' or 'too few/many leaves in this spot.'\xa0 \xa0 It's a series of arcane parameters that get applied to a seed set by the game engine based on the tree entry in question, and the algorithm that governs this process is inhabited by Sheogorath.\xa0[/font]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][font=Times New Roman][size=4]\n<br />[b][size=5]Oblivion

in the direction of a clearer water since I really hadn't considered the fish mods and suchlike the first go-round.\xa0 It's not quite to my tastes just \n<br />yet, but it's probably a better base of

Roman][font=Georgia][font=Times New Roman][size=3][font=Times New Roman][size=5][b]The trees mod has been entirely rebuilt.[/b]\xa0[/size][size=3] In addition to the move to 1024x and 256x for billboards, many of the mod's \n<br />speedtree files now improve significantly on vanilla polycounts.\xa0 [/size][/font][font=Times New Roman][size=3]I'll be very interested to hear how this plays for everyone!\xa0 Thanks for \n<br />bearing with me while I worked this part of the mod up to par.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b]A note for users on trees: I am not necessarily following the vanilla UV texture layouts, so you can't really swap and mix textures unless you \n<br />look at them in an image editor to see what I'm up to first. Given that, if you want to remove a texture, just make sure you also remove the \n<br />.spt file and billboard(s) associated with it (no mysteries here, you can tell by the names).[/size][/font]\n<br />[/size][size=4]\n<br />[/size][/font][/font]\n<br />[font=Georgia][font=Times New Roman][size=4][font=Times New Roman][font=Times New Roman][size=5][b]Grasses are now a core part of the mod.[/b][/size][size=3]\xa0 These include modified versions of Elbethian's fary cry grass meshes &amp; don't follow the vanilla UV texture layout, so make sure the meshes don't get overwritten. \xa0 If you use Oblivion Reloaded, check that your Oblivion Reloaded config has scale X, Y, and Z set to 1 under the grass section (mine had something else as default). \n<br />\n<br />[/size][/font][/font][/size][/font][/font]\n<br />[size=3]*There are also now rock meshes included in the upload, which redirects the Jerall Mountain rock meshes to use the textures in /rocks and stops the \n<br />game trying to wrap a significant % of them in landscape textures.\xa0 [/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/font][i][size=3]New screenshots, etc will come as I update the description over the next few weeks[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Other Mods that I always install:[/size]\n<br />[/b][size=3]\n<br />VKVII did what I consider to be the quintessential retextures of the Imperial City, Anvil, castles, and cathedrals, as well as some odds and ends like sidewalks/clutter.\xa0 You can find their work on ModDB, and I highly recommend you do just that (I run the mid-res versions)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-[i]modder's tip[/i]:\xa0 the VKVII series of mods overlaps with this one in a few small ways, specifically regarding the city cobblestone textures for Anvil and Chorrol, the latter of which is a piece of a cobblestone set that is used in various ways elsewhere in wilderness areas and in/around settlements. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]I've already mentioned the Improved Trees and Flora mod, which covers tree barks and the remaining shrubbery leaves nicely.\xa0 The same author has also done Improved Chorrol/Bravil/Signs/etc, all of which are likewise top shelf.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3][size=3]NAO is a good, recently-made weather mod that I've enjoyed in my game (just the plugin; I don't really recommend trying to \n<br />run ENBs w Oblivion as a general rule since performance headroom is always so tight)\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />You can use the Enhanced Vegetation plugins (on Nexus) to scale trees &amp; billboards larger by a flat %.\xa0 I use the +10% version personally.\xa0 If you do this, you only want the plugin, so it's a clean, simple solution\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3][i]Regarding upscales[/i]: I generally do like to install 1k upscaled diffuse as a base for things like architecture/creatures/armor/weapons/clothing, [i]but I ditch all the normals[/i].\xa0\xa0 Artifacting in the originals are usually magnified by the upscaling &amp; the peformance hit just isn't worth it for a questionable boost in fidelity over just running the upscaled diffuse (in Windows, *_n to search a folder for only normal maps).\xa0 If there's some common clutter that ends up bothering me I'll snag the diffuse for that as well, but dropping in a bunch of 1k diffuse/normals for clutter is a quick way to push your Oblivion to the wall.\xa0 I suspect a lot of people are layering all their mods over a base of full 1k diffuse/normal upscales and the engine is punishing them for it (hey, I've done it too).[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]General Information on Oblivion Reloaded (OR)[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />OR is one of the best things you can do to your game, and is also the likeliest place you'll get hung up trying to mod Oblivion.\xa0 It also happens to be a hot topic in the community, so it can get a little dicey trying to figure out, well, exactly what you even wanted from OR in the first place when you're dealing with forks, configs, and performance restrictions on an old engine.\n<br />\n<br />About the forks: I have no real knowledge of the individual forks and their development since my time with Oblivion is spent modding and testing, but for the purposes of this mod (and general best practices for Oblivion) you really only need good performance from some key features.\xa0 As time goes on I expect the forks to continue to diverge, which is fine, as long as users like yourself can sift through it all.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Here's my little breakdown, so unless one of the developers of the forks decides to remove these features they should all be there for you:\n<br />\n<br />-A banger feature and one of the principal reasons to play with OR is the shadow system.\xa0 OG Oblivion didn't have shadows outside, and a basic shadow system is one of the best upgrades you can make to the game. \n<br />\n<br />-The basic terrain shader that Oblivion Reloaded uses allows the game to read the alphas on my diffuse textures, which lets textures blend together instead of the muddied transitions from games of yesteryear.\n<br />\n<br />-OR has a water shader system that basically everyone in the community has access to and allows me to pull on levers to better work with water.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Other, optional things I use in OR:[/i]\xa0 the version I have also has SMAA, which is my preference for Oblivion since it's a low performance cost anti-aliasing solution and I can turn all the other AA-related stuff off to get headroom, but like I said that's a preference and if your dev pulls it you can find/add it back in easily using google.\xa0 I also turn on the ambient occlusion.\n<br />\n<br />...and that's it.\xa0 Otherwise I just deleted the meshes and turned off the excess features in the config.\xa0 \n<br />\n<br />This is really all I use out of all of OR, so whatever you do with getting it installed I recommend you don't get bogged down in the weeds!\xa0 I've heard too many people say they fell off modding Oblivion because OR was too confusing (and that was before the forks), so hopefully this helps simplify things a tiny bit.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]\xfeff\x41nd that's all I've got...for the moment[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-anime/comment-face-assets/master/source/animated/micdrop/original/micdrop.gif[/img][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][font=Times New Roman]Old Information on Terrain Shaders[/font][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Times New Roman][spoiler] So, you want those nice landscape transitions you see in the screenshots, but don't know where to start?\xa0 \n<br />\n<br />You have two options:\xa0 Detailed Terrain (DT) or Oblivion Reloaded (OR).\xa0 Personally, I went with Detailed Terrain since it looked better for me, but either should do the trick.\xa0 \n<br />\n<br />For OR, after you get it installed (ugh, that installation process, but such a good mod) you just need to turn on the terrain shader option in the ini file.\xa0 \n<br />\n<br />For Detailed Terrain, download the shader package from the mod page and install.\xa0 Just don't let things overwrite that handful of shader files (for instance, Grass Overhaul needs to let DT overwrite it).\n<br />\n<br />Things get slightly more complicated when you want to use DT and OR together (as I do), but I can vouch for OR v6.4.1 + DT working fine if you turn off the terrain shader in OR.\xa0 You may or may not have trouble with later versions of OR if you go this route, but information is somewhat scarce and I'm busy testing this mod rather than getting into the weeds of those two, so perhaps some intrepid community members can assist if people want more information on this.\xa0 You can get OR 6.4.1 from Squiggle's mod page which you can find with a quick google search.\n<br />\n<br />Now that you've got the shaders going, you need textures with alpha channels to actually get them to do their thing.\xa0 That's where this mod comes into the picture!\xa0 [/font][font=Times New Roman]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Update to this section:\xa0 I've now switched to Oblivion Reloaded 8+
