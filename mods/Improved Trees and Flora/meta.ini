nexusDescription="This is a retexture of several trees, flora, shrubs & fungus. The majority of the texture are 1024x512 & 1024x1024. Over half the trees have been done so a performance hit (more shuttering) when loading new sections may occur. To install unzip or drag to the oblivion folder. If asked to overwrite, choose \\\"Yes\\\". As in my last release a complete uninstall list is included with the readme, so you can pick and choose. This set of textures could be considered as an add-on for improved doors & flora. "
