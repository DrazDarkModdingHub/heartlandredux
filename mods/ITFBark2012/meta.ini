I have included a new canopyshadow texture to make the forest darker and more realistic.If you do not like the new texture (comparison pic included with readme) go to the data/texture/trees and delete canopyshadow.\r\nAs with the last pack there could be a performance hit(more shuttering) as new section load.A uninstall list is included in the read me. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion History\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n1.0 - Initial release\r\n\r\n1.1 - Added ITF2Update file.
