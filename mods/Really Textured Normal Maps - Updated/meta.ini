I like how Oblivion vanlla looks, but a bit more depth can be nice. \n<br />That said, I've noticed and heard about some issues the original mod had and I've attempted to fix them. I removed normal maps for effects and normal maps where the detail was lost. I removed all alpha channels where the vanilla normal map didn't have one and restored the original alpha channel for all other normal maps. \n<br />\n<br />This should fix: \n<br />- Flickering tree bark\n<br />- Broken sunrays in mania smithy\n<br />- Mismatch with OOO SI golden saint/dark seducer armor\n<br />- Lost details on weapons, especially fine steel weapons\n<br />- Lost glossiness on some surfaces, too glossiness shine on others\n<br />\n<br />This package includes all 3 original downloads, part 1, part 2 and the shivering isles one!\n<br />\n<br />It's a lot of files, I might have missed something, if you notice anything weird, let me know. \n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/38204]Link to original[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#e69138]\xb7 - =[/color] [color=#f6b26b]| In[/color][color=#f9cb9c]st[/color][color=#fce5cd]a[/color]ll[color=#fce5cd]at[/color][color=#f9cb9c]io[/color][color=#f6b26b]n |[/color] [color=#e69138]= - \xb7[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />By the nine, use a mod manager to install this. It's almost 3000 files, you will never be happy again if you install this manually. \n<br />You probably want to install this before other texture replacers, so they can overwrite it. Otherwise you might end up with mismatching normal maps. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Make sure to fully uninstall Really Textured Normal Maps for Vanilla if you used it before.[/b]"
