nexusDescription="[img]https://i.imgur.com/xSxHV10.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Pick Me![/b]\n<br />\n<br />A pretty straightforward facelift of lockpicking interface. \n<br />I like the lockpicking minigame - it's challenging and immersive in its own way - but for a long time I had been avoiding it without fully realising why. I used various mods that skipped this minigame altogether, only to finally come to the conclusion that the actual reason for my lukewarm feelings towards it was the garish, cartoonish vanilla texture. So I decided to give it a more modern, kind of 3D look, and voil\xe0 - it feels soooo much better now. It's still almost the same vanilla design (it was actually rather nice, although utterly unrealistic - I'm feeling tempted to deal with it too - but the materials, resolution, and style are more up to date). I feel perfectly comfortable with it now, and I hope some of you will too.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Installation[/u]\n<br />\n<br />As always I recommend Wrye Bash for installing this mod. Just add it to installers, move it down below other UI/texture mods and click [b]Install[/b]. That's it.\n<br />\n<br />You can also install it manually. Unpack the mod somewhere safe, and merge the contents with your Oblivion/Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Compatibility[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[color=orange]My updated lockpick_menu.xml (included) is necessary for the right layout of the graphics (because they're twice the original resolution). By default this mod is compatible with DarNified UI, but can be used with vanilla UI as long as you download and install the optional menu file (it will overwrite DarN's lockpick_menu.xml with one based on vanilla interface).[/color] The optional menu should be copied to Oblivion/Data/Menus (if you use Wrye Bash, you don't have to think about it).\n<br />\n<br />According to Vrugdush: \"[...] vanilla menu version is also compatible with BTmod\". Thanks for confirmation, fellow thief!\n<br />\n<br />Jaikb says: Works fine with Dark Transparent UI as well.\n<br />Thanks, mate!\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy! Happy burgling!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u]Updates[/u]\n<br />\n<br />I've added an optional file with slab of wood in the background for those who liked to have it. Let me know if it's okay, or maybe it should be darker? (I used wood texture from http://www.babaimage.com/generate/related-posts-pink-wood-textures-free-high-res-wood-textures-grey-wood)\n<br />\n<br />I've also added various metal tumblers  (brass, iron, and vanilla) for these of you who think wooden tumblers are not realistic enough :) Just overwrite the old one with this.\n<br />\n<br />I've noticed that previously (before 24 April 2018) vanilla style tumblers were one pixel too wide, resulting in just white square where tumblers should be. I uploaded a version with correct size for these of you who liked vanilla design better."
