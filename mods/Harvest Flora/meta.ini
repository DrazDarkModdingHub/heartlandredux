nexusDescription="This mod will make all flora behave more realistically by changing their appearance when you harvest them (whether you are successful or not). When you harvest a plant if its ingredient is a flower then the plant\\'s flowers will disappear and so on, through some plants ingredients are roots which they don\\'t have and you can\\'t see them anyway so the flowers disappear instead (think of it as you snapping them off to let yourself know you\\'ve already collected the roots from it).\r\n\r\n[i][b]Add-ons[/b][/i]\r\n[b]NoMushroomStalks[/b]\r\nThis will makes mushrooms disappear entirely when harvested instead of leaving stalks behind.\r\n\r\nInstalling: Copy the contents of the NoMushroomStalks folder into your [i]Bethesda Softworks\\\\Oblivion\\\\Data[/i] folder.\r\nUninstalling: Delete the HarvestFlora folder located in [i]Bethesda Softworks\\\\Oblivion\\\\Data\\\\Meshes[/i].\r\n\r\n[b]Harvest [Flora] - Shivering Isles.esp[/b]\r\nAdds support for the new flora added by the official expansion pack: Shivering Isles.\r\n[b]Note:[/b] This must be loaded after Harvest [Flora].esp\r\n\r\n[b]Harvest [Flora] - DLCFrostcrag.esp[/b]\r\nAdds support for the new flora added by the official mod: Frostgrag Spire.\r\n[b]Note:[/b] This must be loaded after DLCFrostcrag.esp and Harvest [Flora].esp\r\n\r\n[b]Harvest [Flora] - DLCVileLair.esp[/b]\r\nAdds support for the new flora added by the official mod: The Vile Lair.\r\n[b]Note:[/b] This must be loaded after DLCVileLair.esp and Harvest [Flora].esp\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Notes, Known Issues & Incompatibilities[/u][/b]\r\n-Behaviour of Nirnroot remains unchanged.\r\n-Pitcher Plants have no ingredient so they will now become un-harvestable (next time the cell resets you\\'ll be unable to attempt to harvest nothing from them).\r\n-Attacking plants like the Spiddel Stick will no longer attack you once harvested.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Installing[/u][/b]\r\n[b]1.)[/b] Extract the files from the archive and place them into your [i]Bethesda Softworks\\\\Oblivion\\\\Data[/i] folder.\r\n[b]2.)[/b] Start the Oblivion Launcher and go to Data Files.\r\n[b]3.)[/b] Enable the plugins you want.\r\n[b]3.)[/b] Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Upgrading[/u][/b]\r\n[b]1.)[/b] When upgrading from previous versions of Harvest [Flora] make sure you remove all the old files located in your [i]Bethesda Softworks\\\\Oblivion\\\\Data\\\\[/i] folder:\r\nDEJ Harvest - Flora - CPU.esp\r\nDEJ Harvest - Flora - LIST.txt\r\nDEJ Harvest - Flora - LITE.esp\r\nDEJ Harvest - Flora - README.txt\r\nDEJ Harvest - Flora - STOP.esp\r\nDEJ Harvest - Flora.bsa\r\nDEJ Harvest - Flora.esp\r\n[b]2.)[/b] Install new version and activate the plugins and you\\'re good to go!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Uninstalling[/u][/b]\r\n[b]1.)[/b] Delete the following from your [i]Bethesda Softworks\\\\Oblivion\\\\Data\\\\[/i] folder:\r\nHarvest [Flora].esp\r\nHarvest [Flora] - Shivering Isles.esp\r\nHarvest [Flora] - DLCVileLair.esp\r\nHarvest [Flora] - DLCFrostcrag.esp\r\nHarvest [Flora].bsa\r\nHarvest [Flora] Readme.html \r\n[b]2.)[/b] And you\\'re done!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)[/u][/b]\r\n[b]Question:[/b] Something strange is happening, plants aren\\'t appearing harvested or it\\'s happening very slowly, what\\'s wrong?\r\n[b]Answer:[/b] What you have is the animation bug (not caused by Harvest [Flora] or any other mod), it usually happens in gamesaves over 200 hours and affects anything animated. To fix this problem you\\'ll need to use zBobGuy\\'s [url=\\\"http://www.tessource.net/files/file.php?id=5127\\\"]Animation Fixer[/url] on your afflicted gamesaves.\r\n\r\n[b]Q:[/b] Will I loss my plants if I remove Harvest [Flora] or upgrade to a new version of Harvest [Flora]?\r\n[b]A:[/b] No and No. Since Harvest [Flora] v3.0.0 plants are no longer disabled and it also acts as a STOP plugin from the previous versions of Harvest [Flora] undoing any disabled flora thus it is safe to enable/disable Harvest [Flora] whenever you like without fear of losing flora.\r\n\r\n[b]Q:[/b] Harvest [Flora] broke my plants in the Vile Lair!!! what do I do?\r\n[b]A:[/b] Was a nasty little bug but has since been fixed in Harvest [Flora] v3.0.0, to get your flora back you\\'ll need to disable DLCVileLair.esp load any afflicted gamesave and resave them then enable DLCVileLair.esp again. [b]Warning:[/b] make sure you take any items you want out of the Vile Lair or you\\'ll lose them, also you\\'ll have to purchase all the upgrades again!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Version History[/u][/b]\r\n[b]v3.0.1 (3/03/2008)[/b]\r\n-Added Harrada fix by Deathless Aphrodite.\r\n-Added OMOD script by -pk-.\r\n[b]v3.0.0 (28/04/2007)[/b]\r\n-Everything has been redone.\r\n-Realistic Flora has been merged into Harvest [Flora] and thus Realistic Flora has been discontinued.\r\n-All plants now utilizes nif animations which eliminates gamesave bloating and the flickering during transition to the harvested plant.\r\n-You can now enable/disable/remove Realistic [Flora] when ever you want now without fear of losing flora or having to run a STOP plugin.\r\n-Now fully compatiable with any mod that adds new flora (harvested versions won\\'t be left behind if you disable that mod) or mods that move existing flora around the place.\r\n-Added support for all the new flora added by the official expansion pack: Shivering Isles.\r\n-Added support for the new flora added by the official mod: Frostcrag Spire.\r\n-Added support for the new flora added by the official mod: The Vile Lair.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Disclaimer[/u][/b]\r\nHarvest [Flora] is provided free and \\\"as is\\\", use at your own risk; we cannot be held responsible/liable for anything that happens while using it.
