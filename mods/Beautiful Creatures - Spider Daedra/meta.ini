nexusDescription="DESCRIPTION:\r<br />----------------\r<br />This is another very simple mod, its a model replacer for the vanilla Spider Daedra meshes\r<br />I made a few tweaks around the face area to make them prettier, i also made a lot of changes on the whole body, in the arms, breasts and torso, now what once was one model is two, one being the suit these creatures wear, and the other one being their body.\r<br />I also made a nude version around which i modeled her suit, so the full nude mesh still exists and it is available as an alternate version\r<br />It comes with the two model versions and a new texture that applies only to the body part, the rest of her still uses the basic texture that comes in the game\r<br />\r<br />V 1.2: main file added small fixes to very small details, you propably wont even notice but im way too much obsessed with details so i had to improve the file\r<br />Now optional files come in separate packs theres optional nude mesh, no crown hair model and veins texture, each one can be mixed with any of the other features\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />------------------\r<br />&#34;Oblivion&#34; by Bethesda\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />-----------------\r<br />Extract the files to a temporary location\r<br />Explore the main file folder, choose your preferences if you downloaded any of the optional files, put files to their correct location and copy the mai folder to Oblivion/Data. No esp required.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall: just delete the files associated with this mod\r<br />\r<br />INCOMPATIBILITIES:\r<br />-----------------------\r<br />Any mod using the same models and some mods using replacement textures like Gizmodian&#39;s textures. Though ive tested other replacers like Mythic Creatures (http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/29569) and the armor parts work just fine\r<br />\r<br />FUTURE PLANS: I also plan on making a bodysuit armor based on creatures models\r<br />Another idea could be to have both models used in the game and also a special conversion of a cave spider creature (in Francesco&#39;s creature mod) i made some daedra textures for, and be the spider that spawns in the spiderling&#39;s place\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Comments: i was looking for something like this and i found another mod by Girass, Gizmodian and Edhildil, but i wanted to take a shot at making something more similar to the original creatures. Its a very good mod but to me it creates an entirely new creature and the textures separate for the original intention of these creatures which seem to be related to lava and red things, besides, the breasts are massive and i wanted them to look more natural. I still consider it to be a very good mod but i just wanted something different so i made this.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like it, if you do, please dont forget to express it&#33; enjoy\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />----------\r<br />Bethesda for creating Oblivion\r<br />SrJoben for Killiana Companion mod (http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/30521) i used it to test this mod"
